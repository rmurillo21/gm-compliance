== Controls and Procedures

=== Vendor Technology Risk Review

{company-short-name} security policy requires a risk review of vendor technology, prior to any technology being integrated to {company-short-name} operations and/or infrastructure.
Employees are required to engage security team to conduct such review.
The request may be submitted by email directly to the security team, or by opening a {ticketing-system} ticket through the {company-short-name} internal service desk.

Security team is responsible to conduct the reviews via interviews and reviews of documentation, to ensure the vendor complies with regulatory requirements and follows security best practices to minimize risk to an acceptable level.

A vendor technology risk (VTR) assessment is conducted using Google VSAQ, in the following steps:

. Reviewer sends questionnaire link(s) to vendor contact.
. Vendor completes the questionnaire(s).
. Vendor saves/exports answers to the assessment questionnaire(s).
. Vendor contact sends the answers file back to reviewer.
. Reviewer opens the same questionnaire(s) and loads the answers received from the vendor to complete the assessment.
. Reviewer follows up with vendor contact as needed.
. Reviewer facilities discussion with business owner to determine if the risk is acceptable.
Vendor remediation may be required depending on the results.

A list of xref:approved-software.adoc[approved vendors / contractors] is maintained by the Security and Operations teams.

=== Vendor Contractual Agreements

*HIPAA.* If the vendor needs access to PHI/ePHI, the vendor must be HIPAA compliant and a xref:hipaa-baa.adoc[Business Associate Agreement (BAA)] is required.

*SLA for Service Providers.* For network and infrastructure service providers that support production and/or critical operations at {company-short-name}, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is defined and included in the service contract.

As appropriate, the executed agreement(s) are linked or attached to the vendor on the xref:approved-software.adoc[approved vendors list].

=== Monitoring Vendor Risks

Vendor contracts are reviewed either annually or according to the signed contract duration.

Based on the risk level and the sensitivity/criticality of data the vendor has access to, the vendor review may include an updated risk analysis performed by the security team in addition to legal and business review of contract terms.

If the vendor is a service provider, the DevOps team monitors the service status of the provider according to its SLA.
This is done by either manually reviewing the posted service status on the vendor's status pages at least quarterly, or by setting up alarms for service interruption using automation.

=== Software and Systems Acquisition Process

{company-short-name} Security maintains a list of xref:approved-software.adoc[pre-approved business software] and a list of xref:approved-vendors.adoc[approved vendors / contractors].

If additional commercial software, hardware system, or cloud services is needed, a request should be submitted through {company-short-name} internal service desk.
This will trigger the approval by manager/security and procurement process.

As applicable, {company-short-name} security team may conduct a risk analysis on the software or system to ensure it complies with {company-short-name} security, compliance and legal requirements and does not interfere with the security controls.
If a risk is identified, additional controls should be identified and implemented (or planned) prior to acquisition.
An alternative product may be considered as a result of the risk analysis.
