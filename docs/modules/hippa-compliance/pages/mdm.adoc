== Controls and Procedures

=== Media Disposal Process

IT and Security is responsible to ensure media containing critical / sensitive data is disposed securely in the following manner:

* The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically, based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.
This may include
 ** Secure wipe;
 ** Physical destruction;
 ** Destruction of encryption keys (if the data on the media is encrypted using a strong algorithm such as AES-256).
* If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.
* All {company-short-name} Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract, they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information.
In cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent its return or destruction/disposal.
* In the cases of a {company-short-name} Customer terminating a contract with {company-short-name} and no longer utilize {company-short-name} Services, data will be returned or disposed per contract agreement or {company-short-name} Platform use terms and conditions.
In all cases it is solely the responsibility of the {company-short-name} Customer to maintain the safeguards required of laws and regulations once the data is transmitted out of {company-short-name} environments.

=== Use of USB Flash Drive and External Storage Device

Per {company-short-name} corporate policy, confidential and critical data may not be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives.
This includes and is not limited to ePHI.
For definition of confidential and critical data, see {company-short-name} Data Classification and Handling Policy.

Usage of USB flash drives for temporary transfer of confidential and critical data may be allowed on a case by case basis, when the following process is followed:

* Data is only allowed on encrypted flash devices approved by {company-short-name} Security and the IT Manager (currently *IronKey*).
* The process starts with the submission of a ticket in {ticketing-system}.
The ticket must be approved by IT and Security.
* Upon completion of data transfer all sensitive data on the device must be completely removed.
* The device is to be returned to the IT Manager to double check that the data has been removed.
* The IT Manager will check the drive back in.

=== Support and Management of BYOD Devices

{company-short-name} provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.

{company-short-name} currently does not require or support employees bringing their own computing devices.

The end-user computing devices are self managed.
Each {company-short-name} employee is responsible to

* configure their laptop/workstation to meeting the xref:ccm.adoc[configuration and management requirements];
and
* ensure the latest security patches are installed or auto-update is enabled.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations and/or technical assistance as needed.
Such configurations are audited daily using *Jamf* centrally managed by the Security team.
